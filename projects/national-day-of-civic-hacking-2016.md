Code for Tucson gathered on the University of Arizona campus on June 4, 2016 to take part in the [National Day of Civic Hacking 2016](https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-2016), a special event coordinated through Code for America, to work on community-centered projects.

During the event we brainstormed and collaborated on projects relating to food scarcity, language and job training resources in Spanish, and the preservation of Tucson’s birthplace.
