# Draft and prototyping CMS for Code for Tucson
## Description

Working out the kinks to make NetlifyCMS friendly enough to use for this specific site. Design to be changed later.
Planning on re-building with Wordpress if time permits as the CMS functions are more robust, but speed and hosting are more of a challenge.

## Todo
- [x] Format navbar
- [x] Add logo and hero to homepage
- [x] Create feature collection and add it to homepage
- [ ] Get Projects page to mimic blog but using the projects collection instead
- [ ] Get projects summary on homepage by pulling it from an existing page (Proof of concept to yank parts of a page to another page)
- [ ] Figure out why hero does not show on other pages
- [ ] Make hero modular by adding to its own component
- [ ] Delete remaining content and add content from existing page
- [ ] Validate that all no links are broken
- [ ] Add styles to support larger screens (Started mobile first)
    -[ ] Add .js to make hero and features scroll
- [ ] Test page and post creation and build todo for CMS
