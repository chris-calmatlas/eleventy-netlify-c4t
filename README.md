# Draft and prototyping CMS for Code for Tucson
## Description

Working out the kinks to make NetlifyCMS friendly enough to use for this specific site. Design to be changed later.
Planning on re-building with Wordpress if time permits as the CMS functions are more robust, but speed and hosting are more of a challenge.
