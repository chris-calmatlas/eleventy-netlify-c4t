Code for Tucson is the Tucson chapter of the [Code for America Brigade](http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/about). We are a group of volunteer [civic hackers](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2013/05/06/what-is-a-civic-hacker/) working together to solve local issues and help people engage with the city.
